                    <h2><i>Gameplay</i></h2><br>
                    <p>Battlegrounds Mobile India is a battle royale game, in which up to 100 players compete in a
                    large-scale lastman standing deathmatch. Players can enter the match as individuals or as small groups of
                    up to four.Each round, the plane's flight path across the map changes, requiring players to quickly
                    determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground. Players begin with no equipment other 
                    than customised clothing options that have no effect on gameplay. Once on the ground, players can search
                    buildings, ghost towns, and other locations for weapons, vehicles, armour, and other items. At the start
                    of a match, these items are procedurally distributed throughout the map, with higher-risk zones typically
                     having better equipment. Finished players can also be looted for their gear. Players can choose to play in
                    first-person or third-person, with each having advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational
                     awareness.</p><br>
